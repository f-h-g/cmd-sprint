Looking for a short mental break from your current project? Then try out cmd-sprint!
===========

The game is simple. Sprint to the end while avoiding obstacles. Run quickly to see your name in the high scores! (Or edit the high score file directly. I won't tell anyone)

Play the game by typing
```javascript
cd node_modules/cmd-sprint
```

then 
```javascript
node runGame.js
```

Directions
---
Type a character input, then press enter to move your character. Walk into open space, jump over rocks, and duck under cacti.

'd' is walk forwards

'w' is jump

's' is duck

(I'm not responsible for any errors that say "The term 'd' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program." if you get too in the zone)
